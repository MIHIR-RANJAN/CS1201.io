    <quest>Why is everything associated with computers referred to as <u>digital</u>? </quest>
    <p>
      The choice of the word <i>digital</i> in English is historical. But the name owes to the fact that everything that has some representation on a modern computer can be converted into a <u>number</u> - an integer more precisely. <span>Any file: text, image, video, a website, or any new app that you want to install on your phone - everything can be mapped to a number</span>. This is the reason the French use the word <i>numerique</i> instead of digital. What this means is that when you take out your phone and capture a picture, you are essentially capturing a unique integer! When you this across to your friend, you are basically transferring this number! Your friend's device interprets this number and lights up the LEDs on the screen in a way that resembles the picture you have taken. As it happens, for technological reasons, it is easier to design machines that work with these <i>numbers</i> represented in binary system than, say, in decimal or octal system. This is the reason why everything is represented as a stream of binary <i>digits</i> in computers - a notion which is quite popular anyway. Not only is everything a number, but everything that you <i>do</i> on a computer is a <u>numerical operation</u>. That is if your friend applies a filter on the picture, what she's doing is to operate a function on the number and transform it to something else.

      Simple may it sound, but to understand this requires some patient understanding of what happens under the hood.

    <b>But can everything be a number? </b>
    <p>
      To motivate this, we considered the possibility of transmitting a piece of <i>text</i> by encoding it as binary digits.
